If modern re«\nligionists had been there, they would have looked\nupon that waste of property with horror, and\nwould have suggested to Noah that, as he needed\nall his precious stock, it would do quite as well\nfor him to take his wife and children round on\nthe shady side of the ark, and hold a prayer\nand conference meeting in which they could\nmake a thank offering.

By the defective plan, those who had little\nor no property, and at the same time had eon-\nsiderable income, in some eases robbed the Lord\n‘of nearly or-quite all the tithes of their actual\nincome. By the Bible plan, one dollar of every\nten earned is secured to the Lord’s cause, This\nalone will make a differeneo of many thousands\nto be cast into the Lord’s treasury for the sup-\n‘port of the eause of God.
